# BidApp
BidApp is a group project. I play a role of **technical lead** and **main programmer**. BidApp is a system providing users with a website, accessible via web browsers on mobile devices, which aimed to improve the process of online auctioning. The user can set and bid an auction in this platform. The fucntions are shown in the following flow-chart. The project was developed with **J2EE, JS, CSS, JQuery**. Some advanced alogrithms are designed and implemented such as proxy bidding, item recommendation, and P2P Network Reputation Management. The project and report was given a **first-class** mark 74, and I got a **highest individual mark 84** (70 is a first class mark in UK, as A+ in US). The source code can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/psyyz10/BidApp) and the report can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/psyyz10/BidApp/blob/master/documents/G52GRPFinalGroupReportGP12-MVR2.pdf).
